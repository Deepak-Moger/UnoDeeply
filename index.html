        <h1>UNO</h1>
        <p>The rules to UNO are simple once you get used to them. We've also included a few common house rules to spice up the game.
            UNO is a fast-paced card game played similar to Crazy 8s that includes special cards that ramp up the fun. Just like another game by the makers of UNO called Phase 10, UNO is suggested for ages 7 and above, but younger kids can still enjoy the game. It can even be a good game to reinforce numbers and colors.

        <u><h1>Basic  cards</h1></u> 
        <section id="BASIC CARD">
          <h2>BASIC CARD</h2>
          <p>Each color contains 19 cards, one number 0 card and two sets of cards numbered 1-9.</p>

        <section id="DRAW4card">
            
            <h2>DRAW 4 card</h2>
            <p>This card forces the next player to draw four cards and skip their turn as if it were the Skip card. Unlike the Wild card, the Wild Draw 4 card cannot be played if the player has a card with the same color and/or number as the face-up card. This card looks like a Wild card with a "+4" symbol on it.
            </p>

        <section id="WILDCARD">
            <h2>WILD CARD</h2>
            <p>This card allows the player to play on any color or numberâ€”even another wild card. They also call out a color for the Wild card, forcing the next player to use that color for play. The Wild card can be played even if the player has another playable card. Wild cards are usually black and feature all four colors on them. If the Wild card or Wild Draw 4 card is the first card turned up in a game, the first player can choose the color.

        <section id="REVERSECARD">
            <h2>REVERSE CARD</h2>
            <p>This card reverses the order of play, switching it from left-to-right or right-to-left. It's great to use to stop a player from going out of cards. Reverse uses a symbol with two arrows going in opposite directions, one on top of the other. The Reverse card has a color and can only be played on face-up cards with that color.

        <section id="DRAW2">
            <h2>DRAW 2</h2>
            <p>This card forces the next player to draw two cards and skip their turn as if it were the Skip card. This card uses a "+2" for a symbol. It has a color and can only be played when the face-up card has the same color.

        <section id="SKIPCARD">
            <h2>SKIP CARD</h2>
            <p>This card causes the next person to lose their turn. Play continues to the next player as if they ended their turn. In two-player games, this card lets you immediately take another turn. The symbol used for Skip is usually a circle with a line through it. The Skip card has a color and can only be played on face-up cards with that color.
